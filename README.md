arduino system to simulate car engine. For testing of various ECU's

This repo contains whole system of arduinos simulating entire car engine. 
Each arduino simulates different part, so it can be tweaked realtime. 
f.e. oil system outputs oil sensor signal based on crankshaft input. 

Purpose - simulate engine so one can connect ECU from 'normal' car to it. 
Good for testing, can work on desktop - no real engine is needed. 
Various systems can be simulated - injectors, lambda sensors, etc. etc. 

work in progress.
